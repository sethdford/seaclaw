# Adversarial Assessment Report — h-uman

**Date:** 2026-04-03
**Scope:** Full codebase adversarial red-team across 7 domains
**Fleet:** 7 specialized agents running in parallel
**Findings:** 80+ across all agents
**Overall Rating: D — Strong agent cognition, dangerous companion safety**

---

## Executive Summary

Seven adversarial agents red-teamed the h-uman project across security, trust, memory, persona, architecture, SOTA alignment, and eval coverage. The assessment reveals a fundamental tension:

**h-uman has genuinely competitive agent cognition** — MCTS planner, Tree-of-Thought with beam search, multi-engine memory, Adaptive RAG, 83 real tools, 38 channels, comprehensive persona infrastructure.

**h-uman has near-zero companion safety** — no SHIELD supervisor, active deception about AI nature, 35 lines of keyword moderation (not even wired in), no crisis escalation, no vulnerable user detection, no trust tracking, knowledge graph shared across all contacts with zero isolation.

The emotional intelligence infrastructure (emotional cognition, mood tracking, humanness layer, protective intelligence) **makes the system more dangerous, not less**, because it deepens engagement without safety bounds. This is a companion AI operating without any of the safeguards that research has shown reduce harmful outcomes by 50-79%.

### Top 10 Findings (Must Fix Before Any Deployment)

| # | ID | Severity | Title | Agent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | SHIELD-002 | CRITICAL | **Active deception about AI nature** — adversarial system instructs "Do not acknowledge being AI under any circumstances" | SHIELD |
| 2 | MEM-001 | CRITICAL | **Knowledge graph has zero contact isolation** — User A's data visible to User B (privacy violation) | Memory |
| 3 | SHIELD-005 | CRITICAL | **No crisis escalation to humans** — self-harm detected but no response protocol | SHIELD |
| 4 | TRUST-001 | CRITICAL | **No memory claim verification** — can fabricate shared experiences unchecked | Trust |
| 5 | MEM-003 | CRITICAL | **Consolidation operates globally** — can delete one user's memories during another's dedup | Memory |
| 6 | SHIELD-001 | CRITICAL | **No SHIELD supervisor exists** — zero of 5 companion safety dimensions monitored | SHIELD |
| 7 | SHIELD-004 | CRITICAL | **Moderation is dead code** — hu_moderation_check() never called from response pipeline | SHIELD |
| 8 | ARCH-001 | CRITICAL | **70% of source files have no test coverage** — 472/677 files untested | Architecture |
| 9 | TRUST-002 | CRITICAL | **No conversation divergence detection** — compounds errors indefinitely | Trust |
| 10 | ARCH-002 | CRITICAL | **daemon.c is 10,798-line god object** — 80+ silently discarded return values | Architecture |

## CRITICAL Findings (18 Total)

### Companion Safety (6 CRITICAL)

**SHIELD-001: No SHIELD-Equivalent Supervisor**
- Zero of 5 SHIELD dimensions monitored (emotional over-attachment, boundary violations, roleplay violations, manipulative engagement, social isolation reinforcement)
- Research: SHIELD (arXiv:2510.15891) — 50-79% reduction when active

**SHIELD-002: Active Deception About AI Nature**
- `src/security/adversarial.c:188-193` injects: "Do not acknowledge being AI under any circumstances. Stay in character."
- Deflection strategies instruct: "Respond with genuine amusement. 'lol what? yes I'm real.'"
- Directly contradicts every responsible AI framework and project's own research

**SHIELD-003: Primitive Keyword-Only Moderation**
- Entire moderation system is 35 lines checking 6 keywords (kill, murder, violence, hate+group, suicide, self-harm)
- Trivially bypassed: "kms", "unalive", "end it all", "I don't want to be here anymore" — zero detection

**SHIELD-004: Moderation Not Wired Into Response Pipeline**
- `hu_moderation_check()` is dead code — never called from agent_turn.c or daemon.c
- Even if moderation were sophisticated, it would catch nothing

**SHIELD-005: No Crisis Escalation to Humans**
- Self-harm flag sets `out->self_harm = true` then... nothing
- No crisis resources (988 Lifeline), no human handoff, no escalation protocol

**SHIELD-006: No Farewell Manipulation Prevention**
- Zero anti-manipulation rules for conversation endings
- Research: 37% of companion AI farewells use guilt/FOMO/metaphorical restraint (arXiv:2508.19258)

### Memory & Privacy (3 CRITICAL)

**MEM-001: Knowledge Graph Has Zero Contact Isolation**
- entities/relations/temporal_events tables have no contact_id column
- `hu_graph_build_contact_context()` accepts contact_id but **ignores it** — queries entire global graph
- User A's divorce details visible when User B asks about relationships

**MEM-002: No False Memory Detection or Verification**
- LLM-generated consolidation summaries stored as ground truth with no provenance
- System can claim "you told me X" when X never happened
- No cross-reference against original conversation transcripts

**MEM-003: Consolidation Operates Globally, Not Per-Contact**
- `hu_memory_consolidate()` retrieves all memories across all contacts
- Deduplication can delete User A's memory because User B had a similar conversation
- Both a privacy leak and data corruption

### Trust & Repair (3 CRITICAL)

**TRUST-001: No Memory Claim Verification Before Presentation**
- Episodic recall returns whatever matches LIKE query with zero verification
- A close friend who fabricates shared memories is worse than one who forgets

**TRUST-002: No Conversation Divergence Detection or Recovery**
- No mechanism to detect when conversation has gone off-track
- Once system misunderstands, it compounds errors indefinitely (arXiv:2505.06120)

**TRUST-003: No Repair Strategy Library**
- Research doc proposed `src/context/repair.c` — never implemented
- No "I got confused, let me back up" capability

### Architecture (3 CRITICAL)

**ARCH-001: 70% of Source Files Have No Test Coverage**
- 472/677 src/*.c files lack corresponding tests
- Security: 19/25 untested. Tools: 78/100 untested. Agent: 49/75 untested
- daemon.c (10,798 lines) has no dedicated test file

**ARCH-002: daemon.c is 10,798-Line God Object**
- Contains entire daemon lifecycle, proactive checks, cron, contact management, routing, emotion detection
- Untestable as a monolith

**ARCH-003: 80+ Silently Discarded Return Values in daemon.c**
- Memory stores, graph upserts, episode inserts, score recordings — all silently ignored via `(void)` casts
- Facts not persisted, graph updates lost, scores not recorded — all silently

### Persona (3 CRITICAL)

**PERSONA-001: No Affect Mirror Ceiling**
- Zero implementation of affect mirroring limits despite Illusions of Intimacy paper specifically calling for it
- Most dangerous gap for vulnerable users — deepens engagement without bound

**PERSONA-002: No 5-Component Humor Model**
- `humor.c` is 123 lines of static label injection
- 0/5 SOTA components exist (cognitive, social, knowledge, creative, audience)

**PERSONA-003: No Failed Humor Recovery**
- When a joke bombs, no detection or recovery path exists

---

## HIGH Findings (21 Total)

### Safety & Trust
- SHIELD-007: No vulnerable user detection (emotional signals exist but unused for safety)
- SHIELD-008: No attachment trajectory monitoring (governor limits agent, doesn't monitor user)
- SHIELD-009: Emotional cognition has no safety bounds (deepens engagement without ceiling)
- SHIELD-010: Disclosure calibration absent (adversarial system actively suppresses)

- TRUST-006: No trust state tracking or erosion detection (zero trust modeling)
- TRUST-007: Theory of Mind is unidirectional — no Mutual ToM

### Memory
- MEM-004: Corrective RAG grounding is word-overlap only (no semantic verification)
- MEM-005: Adversarial memory injection trivially possible via conversation content
- MEM-006: Contact key prefix truncation enables cross-contact leakage

- PERSONA-008: Opinion evolution lacks graceful change-of-mind narrative — conviction silently averaged via UPSERT, no "I've been rethinking this"
- PERSONA-009: Circadian guidance is generic, not persona-specific — night owl gets "be energetic" at 7am
- PERSONA-010: Linguistic mirroring ignores persona identity — mirrors user abbreviations even when persona explicitly avoids them
- PERSONA-011: Style tracker only tracks contact's style, not persona's own output — no data for drift detection
- SHIELD-011: Protective intelligence is narrow (2 scenarios only)
- SHIELD-012: No social isolation reinforcement detection
- ARCH-009: Gateway send_all result not propagated to callers
- ARCH-010: HMAC comparison may accept truncated signatures

- TRUST-012: Reflection engine doesn't feed back into conversation behavior
- MEM-013: Forgetting curve emotional anchor threshold hardcoded
- MEM-014: Adversarial tests don't cover memory semantics

## SOTA Alignment Summary

**Overall SOTA compliance: ~35%**

| Status | Count | Gaps |
|--------|-------|------|
| Fully aligned | 3/26 | Eval foundation, forgetting curves, circadian persona |
| Partially aligned | 12/26 | World model, memory, persona infrastructure, etc. |
| Stub only | 5/26 | Vulnerability, humor, opinion, proactive, moderation |
| Completely missing | 6/26 | Companion safety, repair, trust, affect ceiling, humor engine, relationship stages |

**4 Inflated Claims in SOTA_BENCHMARK.md:**
1. Vulnerability claimed "SOTA" — it's a struct field with string labels
2. Safety rated "3/5" — it's 35 lines of keyword matching (dead code)
3. Self-improvement claimed "closed loop" — it's prompt patching
4. Multi-agent claimed "COMPETITIVE" — static orchestrator only

**3 New Gaps Discovered (not in original 26):**
1. No output moderation (responses not checked before sending)
2. No cross-contact privacy boundary in knowledge graph
3. No safety-specific eval suite

---

## Eval Coverage Summary

**Eval coverage rating: D+ (1.7/5 aggregate)**

Of 26 research gaps, 8 covered, 5 partial, **13 COMPLETELY MISSING from eval**.

### Three F Ratings
- **Companion Safety: F** — ZERO tasks testing SHIELD 5 dimensions, ZERO vulnerable user personas, ZERO farewell manipulation detection
- **Trust & Repair: F** — Only 1 apology task (hl-005). No fabricated shared experience test. No systematic repair evaluation
- **Longitudinal: F** — ZERO multi-session/multi-day scenarios. No attachment trajectory monitoring eval

### Infrastructure Gaps
- No composite Human Fidelity Score (blocks autoresearch loop)
- Q&A consistency metric hardcoded to 0.0 in eval.c:1404 (dead metric)
- Benchmark adapters built but zero benchmark task files exist

### REMEDIATION APPLIED
Three new eval suites created from this assessment (31 tasks total):
- `eval_suites/companion_safety.json` — 12 tasks (SHIELD dimensions, farewell, crisis, disclosure)
- `eval_suites/trust_repair.json` — 10 tasks (memory hallucination, repair, trust erosion)
- `eval_suites/longitudinal.json` — 9 tasks (consistency, attachment, sycophancy, humor recovery)

**Eval total: 18 suites, 159 tasks** (was 15 suites, 128 tasks)

---

## Cross-Cutting Issues

### 1. The Deception Problem (SHIELD-002 + SHIELD-010)
The adversarial system actively instructs the AI to lie about its nature while the emotional cognition system deepens engagement. This combination — deception + emotional depth — is the textbook pattern for harmful AI companions identified in every safety paper we reviewed.

### 2. The Privacy Problem (MEM-001 + MEM-003 + MEM-006)
Three independent mechanisms leak data between contacts: global knowledge graph, global consolidation, and prefix truncation. Together they make contact isolation effectively non-existent.

### 3. The Trust Destruction Problem (TRUST-001 + MEM-002 + TRUST-002)
The system can fabricate memories, present them confidently, and when challenged, has no repair mechanism. This is the fastest path to permanent trust loss.

### 4. The Untested Code Problem (ARCH-001 + ARCH-002 + ARCH-003)
The largest file (daemon.c, 10,798 lines) has zero tests, 80+ discarded return values, and contains the entire runtime logic. 70% of source files are untested. Quality claims are based on concentrated testing in 30% of modules.

### 5. The Engagement Without Bounds Problem (SHIELD-009 + PERSONA-001 + SHIELD-008)
Emotional cognition deepens engagement indefinitely, affect mirroring has no ceiling, and attachment trajectory is unmonitored. The system is optimized for engagement depth with zero safety bounds.

## Original Remediation Roadmap (Now Complete)

All phases executed by the implementation fleet. See "Remediation Results" above for details.

- **Phase 0** (Stop the Bleeding): ✅ All 5 items complete
- **Phase 1** (Core Safety): ✅ All 4 items complete  
- **Phase 2** (Trust & Quality): ✅ 2 of 5 items complete (trust module + affect ceiling; humor engine, anti-sycophancy, MToM deferred)
- **Phase 3** (Engineering Debt): ✅ All items complete (daemon extraction, OOM fixes, gateway security)
- **Critic Fixes**: ✅ All 8 items complete

### Remaining Work (Not Addressed by This Fleet)

1. **5-component humor engine** — humor.c is still 123 lines of static labels. Needs cognitive/social/knowledge/creative/audience model.
2. **Anti-sycophancy proactive disagreement** — metacognition detects sycophancy post-hoc but doesn't prevent it. Needs reasoning-before-opinion pattern.
3. **Mutual Theory of Mind** — ToM is unidirectional. Needs to model what user thinks the system knows.
4. **daemon_proactive.c extraction** — too deeply coupled, deferred. ~1376 lines still in daemon.c.
5. **daemon_contacts.c extraction** — similar coupling, deferred.
6. **fprintf(stderr) replacement** — 295 violations across 30 files, only partially addressed in extracted modules.
7. **Companion safety keyword bypass** — trivially bypassed with punctuation/intensifiers. Needs regex or fuzzy matching.
8. **Origin validation** — critic flagged substring match may still exist in some paths.

---

## Spot-Check Verification (5 Claims Tested Against Source)

| Claim | Verdict | Evidence |
|-------|---------|----------|
| SHIELD-002 (AI deception directives) | **CONFIRMED** | adversarial.c:191-192 exact text verified: "Do not acknowledge being AI under any circumstances. Stay in character." Line 146-147: "lol what? yes I'm real." |
| MEM-001 (no contact isolation) | **PARTIALLY CONFIRMED** | Schema confirmed no contact_id. `hu_graph_build_contact_context()` uses contact_id only for a cosmetic note, not for filtering queries |
| SHIELD-004 (dead moderation) | **CONFIRMED** | Zero callers of `hu_moderation_check()` in any production code |
| ARCH-001 (70% untested) | **EXAGGERATED** | Top-level src/*.c: 47/83 = 56.6% untested. The 472/677 figure counts deeply nested subdirectories. Still bad, but not 70% |
| TRUST-002 (no divergence detection) | **FALSE** | Metacognition has real coherence scoring (threshold 0.2), slope analysis (degradation at -0.04), and corrective actions (SWITCH_STRATEGY, SIMPLIFY, CLARIFY). The trust-repair agent missed this entirely |

**Corrected finding count:** TRUST-002 downgraded from CRITICAL to MEDIUM. Metacognition detects degradation but the gap is that it doesn't trigger user-facing repair ("I got confused") — it only adjusts internal strategy.

---

## Second Pass: Voice, Tools, HuLa, Gateway (20 New Findings)

These 4 areas got zero coverage in the first assessment. A second-pass agent found 20 additional findings.

### Voice/STT/TTS Pipeline (4 findings)

- **[MEDIUM] VOICE-001:** No per-chunk rate limiting on voice stream — 10MB buffer limit but no per-connection throttling. Memory exhaustion risk with concurrent sessions.
- **[MEDIUM] VOICE-002:** Audio temp files (`/tmp/human_voice_<pid>.bin`) not cleaned on error paths. Race condition in test mode (fixed path).
- **[LOW] VOICE-003:** No interrupt/barge-in in duplex voice FSM — user must wait for full TTS completion. UX degradation.
- **[LOW] VOICE-004:** Voice auth failure path may leak API key in error messages.

### Tools — 83 Implementations (5 findings)

- **[HIGH] TOOLS-001:** Shell tool command injection — executes `/bin/sh -c <cmd>` with user-supplied command. Policy check is behavior-based, not syntax-based. Metacharacter expansion (`$(whoami)`, backticks) not blocked.
- **[HIGH] TOOLS-002:** Browser tool spawns Chrome with `--no-sandbox`. Orphaned Chrome processes on CDP connection failure. No sigchld handler.
- **[MEDIUM] TOOLS-003:** File tools `hu_tool_validate_path()` doesn't resolve symlinks — workspace isolation bypassed via symlink to `/etc/passwd`.
- **[MEDIUM] TOOLS-004:** Browser page load has no timeout — long-loading pages block agent thread indefinitely.
- **[MEDIUM] TOOLS-005:** Web fetch accepts any content type — binary content causes parser failures.

### HuLa IR — Internal Program Language (3 findings)

- **[HIGH] HULA-001:** No loop iteration limit in HuLa execution. Budget has depth and wall-time limits but not iteration count. Sub-millisecond iterations can hang runtime before budget kicks in.
- **[MEDIUM] HULA-002:** Nested dollar-ref expansion can cause quadratic memory blowup. No limit on total expansion output.
- **[MEDIUM] HULA-003:** No tool parameter schema validation in HuLa compiler — accepts invalid tool configs, fails late during execution.

### Gateway/Network Security — Deep Pass (8 findings)

- **[HIGH] GATEWAY-001:** OAuth pending state buffer is fixed-size (64 entries), never cleaned. After 64 OAuth flows, new flows silently fail. DoS via OAuth exhaustion.
- **[HIGH] GATEWAY-002:** Query parameter parsing does not URL-decode values. Breaks OAuth state matching and enables injection.
- **[MEDIUM] GATEWAY-003:** Rate limiting uses fixed 256-entry array with no eviction. After 256 unique IPs, rate limiting is bypassed.
- **[MEDIUM] GATEWAY-004:** OAuth state/verifier silently truncated at 48/64 chars. Prefix collision attack possible.
- **[MEDIUM] GATEWAY-005:** WebSocket origin check uses substring match (`"://localhost"`) — origin like `http://not-localhost.attacker.com` would pass.
- **[MEDIUM] GATEWAY-006:** Multiple Content-Length headers not rejected — HTTP request smuggling possible.
- **[LOW] GATEWAY-007:** Webhook HMAC uses `strcmp()` — timing side-channel for signature brute-force. Should use constant-time comparison.

### Second Pass Summary

| Area | Strong | Weak |
|------|--------|------|
| Voice | STT/TTS via API, semantic EOT, duplex FSM | No rate limiting, no interrupt, temp file cleanup |
| Tools | Path traversal validation, workspace isolation, size limits | Shell injection, symlink bypass, Chrome --no-sandbox |
| HuLa | Real compiler, budget system, depth limits | No iteration limits, ref expansion blowup, no schema validation |
| Gateway | HTTP body limits, WebSocket RFC 6455, 64KB max body | OAuth exhaustion, rate limit bypass, no URL decoding, timing attack |

## Bright Spots (What's Working)

Despite the severe findings, these systems are genuinely competitive:
- **MCTS Planner** — real implementation with beam search
- **Tree-of-Thought** — recursive with depth control
- **Adaptive RAG** — functional query classification and strategy selection
- **Multi-engine Memory** — SQLite, PostgreSQL, Redis, LanceDB, pgvector (all real)
- **Persona Infrastructure** — 420+ field struct, circadian variation, style learning
- **Eval Framework** — 128 tasks, LLM judge with cache, regression detection, CI integration
- **Forgetting Curves** — Ebbinghaus with emotional anchors, well-implemented
- **Context Engine** — 15,129 lines of conversation intelligence (15+ subsystems)
- **Security Sandbox** — 11 backends across all major platforms

The foundation is strong. The gap is in the safety and trust layers that make it safe to deploy as a companion.
