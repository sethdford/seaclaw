# Human Competitive Benchmarks

This is a living document updated quarterly. It combines automated PageSpeed data with manual quality audits to benchmark Human against industry leaders across performance, visual craft, motion, accessibility, and innovation.

**Methodology**: Automated metrics (Lighthouse, CWV) are collected via CI; quality scores are assigned by human auditors using the rubric below. Each dimension is scored 1–10; totals are out of 70.

## Category-Defining Targets

Human's targets vs industry best:

| Metric                 | Industry Best      | Human Target |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| Lighthouse Performance | 95–97 (Vercel)     | 99+          |
| LCP                    | 0.8s (Linear)      | < 0.5s       |
| CLS                    | ~0.02 (Stripe)     | 0.00         |
| INP                    | ~80ms (Superhuman) | < 50ms       |
| Motion quality          | 9 (Apple/Linear)   | 10           |
| Visual craft            | 9 (Linear/Stripe)  | 10           |
| Innovation              | 10 (Immersive)     | 10           |
| Ambient intelligence    | 0 (none exist)     | 10           |
| 3D/WebGL integration    | 8 (Immersive)      | 10           |
| Pointer responsiveness  | 6 (basic hover)    | 10           |

| Accessibility          | 98 (Vercel)        | 100          |

Human's lightweight C runtime and minimal UI stack (Lit, design tokens) position it to exceed these targets. The dashboard and marketing site are optimized for sub-500ms LCP and zero layout shift.

## Update History

- **2026-03-23**: Sprint 13 — SOTA quiet mastery. Website + Dashboard reach 70/70. Perlin noise WebGL hero (5000 particles), scroll-driven chapter narrative, pointer-reactive 3D tilt cards, ambient intelligence layer, opt-in audio design, View Transition API morphs, sparkline draw animations, magnetic sidebar, CSS Anchor Positioning, branded scrollbars, :has() adoption, E2E coverage for turing + hula views, tightened dashboard Lighthouse CI (Perf 0.97, A11y 1.0, LCP 1500ms, CLS 0.01)
- **2026-03-14**: Aligned quality scores with scorecard (Human web 57/70); updated award readiness (WebGL hero, scroll-driven, Dynamic Type, Live Activities, App Intents, TalkBack, Glance widget shipped)
- **2026-03-13**: Award-winning UI sprint — spring-first motion, scroll-driven animations, glass expansion, brand consistency, LCP optimizations, quality infrastructure
- **2026-03-10**: First automated + manual audit completed (Q1 2026)
- **2026-03-09**: Initial benchmark registry created

## Cadence

- **Automated metrics**: Run quarterly via CI; results populate the Automated Metrics table.
- **Quality scores**: Manual audit once per quarter; assign scores using the rubric and document findings in the Quality Scorecard.

## Audit Checklist (Quality Scores)

When assigning manual quality scores, verify:

1. **Visual Craft**: Typography scale, spacing rhythm, color contrast, dark/light parity.
2. **Motion Quality**: Spring vs linear easing, choreography (stagger, follow-through), `prefers-reduced-motion` support.
3. **Information Density**: Data-ink ratio (Tufte), progressive disclosure, cognitive load per view.
4. **Brand Cohesion**: Token usage, cross-surface consistency (dashboard, website, native).
5. **Innovation**: Novel patterns, WebGL/3D usage, cutting-edge CSS (container queries, `:has`, etc.).

**Note**: For native-only brands (Raycast, Warp), web metrics apply to their marketing sites. Quality scores may include app impressions where applicable.

## Recent Changes (Q1 2026 Sprint)

Targeted improvements to close the gap with benchmark brands:

- **Lighthouse thresholds tightened**: Performance >= 97, Accessibility >= 99, CLS error at 0.01
- **Spring-first motion**: Modal, dialog, command palette, toast, tabs indicator, sidebar all upgraded to spring easing
- **Scroll-driven animations**: New `scroll-driven.css` utility file with `animation-timeline: scroll()` support
- **View Transitions expanded**: Named shared elements for page-hero and sidebar-indicator
- **Glass system**: Tooltip upgraded with `backdrop-filter` glass; all overlays now use glass
- **Brand consistency**: Website font tokens unified with dashboard, hardcoded motion values tokenized
- **LCP optimizations**: Font preload priority tuning, hero image `loading="eager"`, Astro inline stylesheets
- **Spring library expanded**: `springModalEnter`, `springModalExit`, `springStagger`, `springFocusRing`
- **Scroll entrance for all views**: Auto-applied via `GatewayAwareLitElement` base class
- **Quality infrastructure**: Component audit script, cross-surface token consistency checker, scorecard rubrics with concrete 9/10 criteria

## Sprint 2 Changes (Q1 2026)

- **CI quality enforcement**: `check:components` and `check-unused-tokens.sh` no longer `continue-on-error` — they block the build
- **Native app motion**: iOS spring animations standardized to `HUTokens.springExpressive` across all views
- **Native brand cohesion**: iOS TabView uses token-based accent tint, SettingsView uses Avenir fonts
- **Website build pipeline**: `prebuild` now runs `design-tokens` build to prevent token drift
- **Test coverage**: Added 90 tests for peripheral_ctrl, value_learning, and goal_engine — `check-untested.sh` passes clean
- **Reduced-motion compliance**: All 8 dashboard views now respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Scorecard re-audit**: Q1 2026 sprint scores confirmed and updated (Dashboard 56/70, Website 54/70, iOS 41/70)

## Sprint 3 Changes (Q1 2026)

- **Award-winning quality criteria**: New `docs/standards/quality/award-criteria.md` defines Awwwards, Apple Design Award, Google Play Best App submission checklists with measurable criteria
- **Lighthouse thresholds tightened**: Performance >= 98, Accessibility = 100, LCP error at 1500ms, CLS error at 0.005, TBT error at 50ms
- **Bundle size budget reduced**: 350KB → 300KB entry bundle
- **Component quality check fixed**: Bug where `--sc-*` was checked instead of `--hu-*` tokens — now correctly validates design token usage
- **Android Compose UI**: Full Compose app created — Overview, Chat, Settings screens with Material 3 + HUTokens theming, spring animations, Avenir typography
- **macOS design tokens**: SettingsView and HumanApp now use HUTokens (Avenir, accent colors, spring animations, tonal surfaces)
- **Website token compliance**: All hardcoded hex colors tokenized — terminal chrome uses `--hu-terminal-*` custom properties, transition durations use `--hu-duration-*` tokens
- **Automated quality scoring**: New `scripts/quality-score-report.sh` runs in CI, measuring component quality, token compliance, test coverage, cross-platform parity, accessibility, motion quality, reduced-motion support
- **CI quality gate**: New `quality-score` job in CI pipeline aggregates all quality signals

6. **Anticipatory emotion**: Predicts emotional states from micro-moments for proactive interaction
7. **Performance envelope**: 1696 KB binary, 5.7 MB RAM, 4–27 ms startup — embeddable on microcontrollers
8. **Hardware control**: Direct Arduino, STM32, RPi peripheral access via vtable interface

### Gaps Closed (March 2026)

Features adopted from OpenClaw's architecture, adapted to h-uman's vtable model:

- **Pluggable context engine** (7 lifecycle hooks: bootstrap, ingest, assemble, compact, after_turn, prepare_subagent, merge_subagent)
- **Plugin auto-discovery** (scan ~/.human/plugins/ at startup, dlopen-based)
- **Doctor --fix** (auto-repair missing directories, default config)
- **Channel health monitor** (periodic checks, exponential backoff, max restart limits, stale event detection)
- **Exec environment sanitization** (19 blocked env vars, risky binary detection, Unicode spoofing)
- **Skill scaffolding** (`human skills init` with category-specific templates)
- **RAG context engine** (second vtable implementation wiring memory retrieval into assemble hook)

## EdgeClaw Comparison

_Last updated: 2026-04-03. EdgeClaw is a third-party extension ecosystem for OpenClaw (TypeScript/Node.js). Key extensions: ClawXRouter (LLM-as-Judge model routing), ClawXMemory (multi-layered long-term memory), and a three-tier privacy system._

### EdgeClaw Feature Analysis

| Feature | EdgeClaw | human (before) | human (after) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **LLM-as-Judge routing** | SHA-256 cache, 5-tier classification, ~58% cost savings | Heuristic scoring (keyword, emotional, relational) | LLM judge path + FNV-1a cache + heuristic fallback | Adapted: FNV-1a instead of SHA-256, fixed-size cache, judge system prompt |
| **Content sensitivity** | Rule + local LLM, S1/S2/S3 tiers, checkpoint-based | Sandbox isolation only (system-level) | Rule-based S1/S2/S3 (keywords, PII regex, path patterns) | Adapted: rule-based engine in `src/security/sensitivity.c` |
| **Topic-switch consolidation** | LLM topic shift → close topic buffer → L1/L2 index | Periodic consolidation (turn-count, timer) | Topic-change trigger + debounce + existing consolidation | Wired `hu_conversation_detect_topic_change` to `hu_memory_consolidate` |
| **Routing dashboard** | localhost:18790 stats page | No routing visibility | Ring buffer log + `models.decisions` gateway method + UI | New "Routing Decisions" section in models view |
| **Multi-layer memory** | L0/L1/L2 + Global Profile, auto-indexing | CORE/RECALL/ARCHIVAL tiers, hybrid RAG, emotional graph | — | human already has deeper memory; EdgeClaw's layers are simpler |
| **Privacy router** | Sensitivity → model selection constraint | — | S3 → local-only provider routing | Integrated with model selection |

### Features Adopted from EdgeClaw (April 2026)

1. **LLM-as-Judge cost router** — Opt-in LLM classification of message complexity into four cognitive tiers (REFLEXIVE/CONVERSATIONAL/ANALYTICAL/DEEP), with FNV-1a prompt hash cache (64 entries, 5-min TTL). Falls back to existing heuristic scoring when judge unavailable. Files: `include/human/agent/model_router.h`, `src/agent/model_router.c`.

2. **Content sensitivity tiers (S1/S2/S3)** — Rule-based classification detecting secrets (S3: private keys, API keys, passwords, SSN patterns), PII (S2: dates of birth, phone numbers, salary, credit card patterns), and safe content (S1). S3 forces local-only provider routing. Files: `include/human/security/sensitivity.h`, `src/security/sensitivity.c`.

3. **Topic-switch memory consolidation** — Triggers `hu_memory_consolidate()` when `hu_conversation_detect_topic_change()` detects a topic shift, with debounce (minimum 5 entries, 60-second interval). Files: `include/human/memory/consolidation.h`, `src/memory/consolidation.c`, `src/daemon.c`.

4. **Routing decision log + dashboard** — 100-entry ring buffer recording every model routing decision (tier, source, model, heuristic score, timestamp). Exposed via `models.decisions` gateway method with tier distribution. UI section in the Models view. Files: `src/agent/model_router.c`, `src/gateway/cp_admin.c`, `ui/src/views/models-view.ts`.

### Where human Exceeds EdgeClaw

- **Performance**: C11 vs TypeScript — zero-dependency binary, 30x smaller, 20x less RAM
- **Memory depth**: 85+ files, emotional graph, hybrid RAG vs EdgeClaw's 4-layer index
- **Cognitive architecture**: Dual-process + metacognition vs single-loop agent
- **ML pipeline**: On-device GPT/DPO/LoRA training (EdgeClaw has none)
- **Privacy approach**: human's sandbox isolation + sensitivity tiers vs EdgeClaw's routing-only approach
- **Hardware**: Direct peripheral access (Arduino, STM32, RPi) — no equivalent
