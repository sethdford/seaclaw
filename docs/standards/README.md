# Standards Index

Canonical source of truth for all project standards. AI agents and human contributors reference these docs -- they are never duplicated, only pointed to.

## How This Works

```
docs/standards/          <- Canonical source (write and review here)
    |
.cursor/rules/*.mdc      <- Cursor agent rules (reference, never duplicate)
    |
CLAUDE.md                <- Quick reference for all agents
    |
AGENTS.md                <- Full engineering protocol
```

**Rules:**

1. Every standard has ONE home in `docs/standards/`
2. AI config files (`.mdc`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`) reference standards -- they don't duplicate them
3. Standards are concise and actionable -- no fluff, no essays
4. Every rule has a concrete example of right vs. wrong where applicable
