# Security Module (High Risk)

This is a high-blast-radius area. Read AGENTS.md sections 3.5 and 7.5 before any change.

## Principles

- Deny-by-default for all access and exposure boundaries
- Never log secrets, raw tokens, or sensitive payloads
- HTTPS-only for all outbound URLs
- Every change must include threat/risk notes in the commit message

## Specific Rules

- Pairing: never weaken lockout thresholds or bypass code validation
- AEAD: use stack buffers for decrypt, then dupe()
- Secret store: always check encrypt/decrypt return values
- Policy: never silently broaden permissions or capabilities

## Required Tests

- At least one boundary/failure-mode test per change
- Test lockout, invalid input, privilege escalation paths
- Use `HU_IS_TEST` for crypto or network operations
