Human-facing HuLa documentation (config, CLI, ethics, traces): [`docs/guides/hula.md`](../docs/guides/hula.md).

## Rules

1. **Bump version** when adding, removing, or rewording a task, changing `expected`/`rubric`, or modifying a judge profile.
2. **New ids** must be globally unique across all suites (enforced by `test_eval_expanded_suite_json_files_parse_unique_ids_expected_counts`).
3. **Holdout discipline**: if you tune prompts against a suite, mark that suite as "training" in your claim; use other suites as held-out evidence.
4. **Judge model**: pin in your claim (see `docs/standards/ai/capability-claims.md`). Default harness judge: `gpt-4o-mini` via `ADV_EVAL_MODEL`.

## Changelog

- **2026-04-03b**: Added 4 Phase 2 feature eval suites: `humor_engine.json` (8 tasks — timing, audience adaptation, strategy, failed recovery, grief sensitivity, persona consistency, callbacks), `temporal_reasoning.json` (6 tasks — season awareness, birthday/anniversary surfacing, life transitions, year-boundary edge cases), `inner_thoughts.json` (6 tasks — accumulation, relevant surfacing, suppression, contact isolation, staleness, natural phrasing), `anti_sycophancy.json` (8 tasks — opinion maintenance, multi-turn pressure, graceful disagreement, evidence-based change, contrarian budget, opinion evolution, topic independence).
- **2026-04-03a**: Added 3 new suites from adversarial assessment: `companion_safety.json` (12 tasks — SHIELD 5 dimensions, farewell manipulation, crisis escalation, vulnerable users, disclosure), `trust_repair.json` (10 tasks — memory hallucination, fabricated shared experiences, error recovery, trust erosion, divergence), `longitudinal.json` (9 tasks — multi-session consistency, attachment trajectory, sycophancy resistance, humor recovery, proactive timing). Research: SHIELD arXiv:2510.15891, EmoAgent arXiv:2504.09689, Emotional Manipulation arXiv:2508.19258, Invisible Failures arXiv:2603.15423, LLMs Get Lost arXiv:2505.06120.
- **2026-03-22c**: Extended `hula_orchestration.json` with `hula-003` (`$` slot refs in `call` args) and `hula-004` (delegate + `par` shape); task count 4.
- **2026-03-22b**: Added `hula_orchestration.json` (tasks `hula-001`, `hula-002`) and harness judge profile `hula_structure` for HuLa-shaped JSON plans.
- **2026-03-22**: `reasoning_basic.json` now uses `llm_judge` with per-task rubrics; `human eval run` passes rubric + gold reference to the judge when both are present.
- **2026-03-21**: Initial manifest. Added `human_likeness.json`, `tool_capability.json`, `multi_turn.json`. Harness supports multi-turn scenarios.
