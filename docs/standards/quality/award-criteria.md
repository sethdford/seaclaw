| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Performance   | Lighthouse 100, LCP <0.2s, zero-JS critical path, streaming SSR                |
| Visual Craft  | Competitors study your UI; featured in design publications                     |
| Motion        | Indistinguishable from native on every platform; custom physics engine         |

## Recent Completions (Q1 2026)

- Design token pipeline across all platforms (CSS, Swift, Kotlin, Dart, C)
- Glass morphism system (`.hu-glass-*` tiers, choreography, visionOS-style materials)
- Spring animations across 36+ files
- `prefers-reduced-motion` in 95+ files
- axe-core accessibility E2E tests (all 14 dashboard views)
- Container queries for responsive layouts (overview-view, website)
- View transitions and scroll-driven animations
- C test suite: 4919+ tests passing

## Measurement Automation

All criteria marked as "automated" should be enforced in CI:

- Lighthouse scores: `.lighthouserc.json` thresholds
- axe-core violations: `accessibility.spec.ts` E2E test
- Bundle size: `check-bundle-size.sh`
- Token compliance: `lint:tokens` + `lint-raw-colors.sh`
- Component quality: `check:components`
- CLS/LCP/INP: Lighthouse CI assertions

Manual criteria require quarterly audit per `docs/standards/quality/ceremonies.md`.
