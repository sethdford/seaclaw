# Data Customization Guide

The runtime includes configurable data files that control prompt behavior, conversation patterns, memory analysis, security rules, and more. Users can customize any data file by placing an override in `~/.human/data/`.

## How Overrides Work

At startup, `hu_data_load()` checks for user customizations in this order:

1. **User override**: `~/.human/data/<relative-path>`
2. **Embedded default**: Compiled into the binary from `data/` directory

If a user-provided file exists, it takes precedence. Otherwise, the embedded default is used.

**File size limit**: 1 MB per file

## Behavioral Thresholds

The `behavior` config section in the runtime configuration controls seven key thresholds. These can be customized by creating a config file at `~/.human/config.json` (separate from data files).

| Threshold                     | Key                        | Default | Range    | Purpose                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Group chat consecutive limit  | `consecutive_limit`        | 3       | 1–100    | Max consecutive messages in group chat before stepping back   |
| Group participation threshold | `participation_pct`        | 40      | 1–100    | Minimum percentage of total messages before agent joins group |
| Max response length           | `max_response_chars`       | 300     | 1–100000 | Character limit for responses                                 |
| Min response length           | `min_response_chars`       | 15      | 1–1000   | Minimum characters to send (avoid single-word responses)      |
| Memory decay window           | `decay_days`               | 30      | 1–365    | Days before memories fade in consolidation                    |
| Deduplication threshold       | `dedup_threshold`          | 70      | 1–100    | Similarity percentage (0–100) to consider memories duplicates |
| Missed message threshold      | `missed_msg_threshold_sec` | 1800    | 60–86400 | Seconds gap to trigger "missed message" acknowledgment        |

## How to Customize

### 1. Create Override Directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.human/data
```

### 2. Copy and Edit Data File

```bash
# Example: customize filler words
cp data/conversation/filler_words.json ~/.human/data/conversation/filler_words.json
# Edit the file
nano ~/.human/data/conversation/filler_words.json
```

### 3. Restart Daemon

Changes are loaded at startup:

```bash
hu_daemon restart
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Make Responses Shorter

**File**: `~/.human/data/behavior.json`

```json
{
  "behavior": {
    "max_response_chars": 150,
    "min_response_chars": 10
  }
}
```

Restart to apply.

### Example 2: Customize AI Disclosure Detection

**File**: `~/.human/data/conversation/ai_disclosure_patterns.json`

Add or remove patterns the agent should flag:

```json
{
  "patterns": [
    "i'm an ai",
    "i am an ai",
    "as an ai",
    "my custom pattern here",
    "another phrase to filter"
  ]
}
```

### Example 3: Add New Filler Words

**File**: `~/.human/data/conversation/filler_words.json`

```json
{
  "fillers": [
    "haha ",
    "lol ",
    "yeah ",
    "honestly ",
    "tbh ",
    "ngl ",
    "hmm ",
    "oh ",
    "ah ",
    "like ",
    "yo ",
    "dude "
  ]
}
```

### Example 4: Tune Group Chat Behavior

**File**: `~/.human/data/behavior.json`

```json
{
  "behavior": {
    "consecutive_limit": 2,
    "participation_pct": 50
  }
}
```

- Agent steps back after 2 consecutive messages
- Only joins groups where it has >50% participation rate

### Example 5: Adjust Memory Consolidation

**File**: `~/.human/data/behavior.json`

```json
{
  "behavior": {
    "decay_days": 60,
    "dedup_threshold": 80
  }
}
```

- Memories fade after 60 days (instead of 30)
- Consolidation considers memories duplicates at 80% similarity (more aggressive dedup)

### Example 6: Customize Circadian Phases

**File**: `~/.human/data/persona/circadian_phases.json`

Modify the guidance for specific times:

```json
{
  "phases": [
    {
      "name": "early morning",
      "guidance": "The user is just waking up. Be extremely gentle, supportive, and don't ask questions. Just listen."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Validation

Data files are validated at parse time. Common errors:

- **Invalid JSON**: Check syntax with `jq` or a JSON validator
- **File too large**: Max 1 MB per file
- **Missing required fields**: Some files have required keys (check examples above)

Validation errors log to stderr and fall back to the embedded default.

## Debugging

Check if your override is being loaded:

```bash
# Run in debug mode (requires debug build)
HU_DEBUG_DATA=1 hu_daemon start

# Look for logs indicating which path was loaded
```

To verify file ownership and permissions:

```bash
ls -la ~/.human/data/conversation/filler_words.json
```

Ensure the file is readable by the user running the daemon.

## Files Guaranteed to Override

All files in `data/` can be overridden. The system never hardcodes behavior — every tunable aspect is in a data file.

**Do not edit these files in the binary** — always place customizations in `~/.human/data/`.
