# Competitive Intelligence & Category-Defining Standards

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Build a formal competitive benchmarking framework, raise all design standards above the industry ceiling, and create automated infrastructure to measure and enforce category-defining quality across every UI surface.

**Architecture:** Competitive benchmark registry (15 brands, 7 scoring dimensions) + upgraded design docs with category-defining bars + automated PageSpeed/Lighthouse/CWV competitive analysis scripts + per-surface quality scorecard.

**Tech Stack:** Google PageSpeed Insights API (v5), Lighthouse CI, axe-core, Playwright, shell scripts, markdown docs.

---

## 1. Design Context

### Problem

SeaClaw's design system references SOTA sources (Apple HIG, Material Design 3, Disney/Pixar, Tufte, Dieter Rams, NNG) but lacks:

- **Named competitive targets** — no specific brands to measure against
- **Quantified deltas** — no data on where we stand vs. leaders
- **Category-defining ambition** — current bars are "match industry good" not "redefine the ceiling"
- **Automated competitive measurement** — Lighthouse runs on us but not on competitors
- **Cross-surface quality scoring** — no unified scorecard across website, dashboard, iOS, Android, Flutter

### Vision

SeaClaw becomes the brand that other developer tools benchmark against. Not parity — dominance. Every UI surface simultaneously the most functional AND the most beautiful version of that element in the developer tools space.

## 2. Competitive Benchmark Registry

| ------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Lighthouse Performance    | 95-97 (Vercel)        | **99+**        | Astro static + aggressive prefetch + edge CDN                      |
| LCP                       | 0.8s (Linear)         | **< 0.5s**     | Inline critical CSS, prerendered content, zero JS in critical path |

### 3.2 Interaction Latency — Instant by Default

| Interaction                  | Industry Best      | SeaClaw Target                  | How                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |

## 4. Standards Doc Upgrades

### 4.1 `visual-standards.md` — New Principles

#### Zero-Compromise Aesthetics

Stripe proved beauty elevates utility by 20%. SeaClaw goes further: every pixel must simultaneously be the most functional AND the most beautiful version of that element in the developer tools space. No trade-off mentality. If a design choice requires choosing between craft and function, the design is wrong — find the third option.

#### Perceptual Performance

Beyond actual performance metrics, visual design must _feel_ faster than it is. Skeleton-to-content transitions, optimistic UI, instant visual feedback before data arrives. The competitive ceiling isn't "fast loading" — it's "I never noticed it loaded."

#### Depth as Language

Our glass system (3 tiers + Apple visionOS materials + choreography) already exceeds Linear's Liquid Glass. Push further: spatial UI where depth conveys information hierarchy, not just decoration. No other dev tool does this.

#### Monochrome Confidence

The UI must work beautifully in near-monochrome. Accent color is a surgical instrument, not a theme. Linear and Superhuman prove that restraint is power.

#### Calm Technology (from Stripe)

Powerful functionality that doesn't demand attention. Subtle animations that guide without distracting. The three-tier quality litmus: utility (does it work?), usability (is it comfortable?), beauty (is it well-executed?). All three addressed simultaneously, never sequentially.

#### Typographic Confidence (from Awwwards winners)

Type as a primary design element, not just for reading. Award winners (Malvah, Lando Norris) use oversized display type, letter-spacing as texture, type-as-hero. Mathematically perfect type scale with modular ratio baked into tokens.

#### New Quality Bar Table

Every quality checklist item gets a "Competitive Ceiling" column showing what the best brands achieve, and a "SeaClaw Target" column showing our category-defining bar.

### 4.2 `ux-patterns.md` — New Principles

#### Anticipatory UX

Beyond "fast interactions" — build UX that predicts what you need. Prefetch likely next views. Pre-render command palette results. Load data for the detail pane you'll probably click. The user should never wait. Not "fast" — instant.

#### Information Theater (from Tufte, weaponized)

Data presentation so clear that understanding is involuntary. No legends needed. No explanation text. The chart IS the explanation. Push beyond "good data-ink ratio" to "zero learning curve data."

#### Keyboard-First Design (from Linear/Superhuman)

Every view has a complete keyboard interaction model. Command palette is primary navigation, not a nice-to-have. Shortcuts discoverable through contextual hints.

#### Config-as-Composition (from Figma/Scout Motors)

Complex configuration flows feel like creative composition, not form-filling. Visual previews, drag-and-drop, contextual feedback.

#### Platform Transcendence

Don't just be "good on each platform." Be the app that makes people say "this is the best-designed app on my [device]." Each surface designed by someone who lives on that platform.

#### Sub-100ms Interaction Contract (now sub-50ms)

Measured, not felt. CI enforced. Every interaction type has an explicit latency budget.

### 4.3 `motion-design.md` — New Capabilities

#### Real Spring Physics

Move beyond cubic-bezier approximations. Use `linear()` with 60+ keyframes for true damped harmonic oscillator curves. Springs indistinguishable from native iOS animations. Adopt Web Animations API `spring()` timing function when stable.

#### Scroll-Driven Narratives

CSS `scroll-timeline` and `view-timeline` are stable. Codify scroll-driven animation patterns: parallax headers, progressive reveal sequences, section entrance choreography. The website should rival Lando Norris / Immersive Garden for scroll experience.

#### Ambient Intelligence

Subtle motion that responds to context: glass blur density shifting with scroll depth, gradient animations responding to mouse proximity, status indicators breathing with system health. Communication through motion, not decoration.

#### Transition Orchestration

View Transitions API for seamless cross-page morphs. Elements have spatial memory — a card that expands to detail view morphs, never fade-and-replaces. Shared element transitions across routes.

#### Narrative Motion (from Spotify Wrapped)

Animation that tells a story. Staggered data reveals, sequential storytelling through motion choreography. Loading sequences that build anticipation.

### 4.4 `design-strategy.md` — New Sections

#### Competitive Dominance Metrics

Every token table gets a "Category Status Quo" column and a "SeaClaw Redefines" column showing where we set the new ceiling.

#### Design Innovation Pipeline

Every quarter, evaluate and adopt one emerging web platform feature before competitors:

- CSS `@starting-style` for entry animations
- Anchor Positioning API for contextual UI
- `popover` attribute for lightweight overlays
- `scrollbar-color` and `scrollbar-width` for branded scrollbars
- `@container` queries for component-level responsive design
- View Transitions API for cross-page morphs
- `scroll-timeline` for scroll-driven animations

## 5. Automated Benchmarking Infrastructure

### 5.1 Competitive PageSpeed Script

New `scripts/benchmark-competitive.sh`:

- Calls Google PageSpeed Insights API (v5) for SeaClaw + all 15 competitor marketing sites
- Collects: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO + Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP, TTFB)
- Outputs: `benchmark-competitive.json` + `docs/competitive-benchmarks.md` (markdown summary table)
- Runs on-demand locally and weekly in CI (scheduled GitHub Action)
- Requires `PAGESPEED_API_KEY` secret

### 5.2 Enhanced Lighthouse CI

Upgrade `.lighthouserc.json`:

```json
{
  "ci": {
    "collect": {
      "staticDistDir": "website/dist",
      "numberOfRuns": 5
    },
    "assert": {
      "assertions": {
        "categories:performance": ["error", { "minScore": 0.95 }],
        "categories:accessibility": ["error", { "minScore": 0.98 }],
        "categories:best-practices": ["error", { "minScore": 0.95 }],
        "categories:seo": ["error", { "minScore": 0.95 }],
        "largest-contentful-paint": ["error", { "maxNumericValue": 1500 }],
        "cumulative-layout-shift": ["error", { "maxNumericValue": 0.05 }],
        "interactive": ["error", { "maxNumericValue": 2000 }]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 5.3 New CI Workflow: `competitive-benchmark.yml`

- Trigger: weekly schedule (Sunday night) + manual dispatch
- Jobs: run `scripts/benchmark-competitive.sh` against all 15 competitors
- Artifact: upload `benchmark-competitive.json` and markdown report
- Alert: post to Slack/Discord if SeaClaw drops below any competitor on any Core Web Vital

### 5.4 UI Dashboard Performance Tests

Add to Playwright E2E:

- INP measurement for key interactions (button click, view switch, command palette)
- Time to Interactive budget assertion (<2s)
- Interaction latency assertions per interaction type

### 5.5 Quality Scorecard

New `docs/quality-scorecard.md`:

- Per-surface scoring (website, dashboard, iOS, macOS, Android) on all 7 dimensions
- Updated quarterly with competitive comparison
- Tracked in `quality-scorecard-history.json` for trend analysis

## 6. New Documents Created

## 9. Risks

| Risk                                                         | Mitigation                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PageSpeed API rate limits                                    | Use API key, batch requests, cache results                            |
| Aggressive Lighthouse thresholds break CI                    | Phase in: warning first, error after website optimizations land       |
| Manual scoring dimensions are subjective                     | Create detailed rubrics with example scores for calibration           |
| Quarterly scorecard cadence too slow                         | Start quarterly, accelerate to monthly if momentum allows             |
| Some targets (0.00 CLS, <16ms key response) are aspirational | Track as stretch goals, enforce achievable intermediate targets in CI |
