## Tracking Legend

Each task uses this status tracking:

- `[ ]` — Not started
- `[~]` — In progress
- `[x]` — Complete
- `[!]` — Blocked
- `[—]` — Cancelled

**Quality Rating** (applied at phase audit):

- **A** — Exceeds SOTA benchmarks
- **B** — Meets SOTA benchmarks
- **C** — Functional but below SOTA
- **D** — Stub/partial, not production-ready
- **F** — Missing or broken

---

# Phase 1: Evaluation Foundation

> _"You cannot improve what you cannot measure."_

**Goal:** Build a production-quality evaluation framework that can measure agent performance across all dimensions, with LLM-as-judge, regression tracking, and integration with industry-standard benchmarks.

**Timeline:** 2 weeks
**Risk:** Low (additive, no behavioral changes)
**Dependencies:** None — this is the foundation everything else builds on.

---

## AGI-E1: Eval Task Loader & Runner

**Description:** Complete the eval framework so it can load task suites from JSON, execute them against any provider/model, collect results, and produce reports.

**Files:**

- Modify: `src/eval.c` — implement task parsing, runner loop
- Modify: `include/human/eval.h` — add runner API (`hu_eval_run_suite`)
- Create: `src/eval_runner.c` — task execution engine
- Create: `include/human/eval_runner.h` — runner interface
- Create: `tests/test_eval_runner.c` — runner tests
- Create: `eval_suites/` — directory for eval suite JSON files

**Steps:**

1. Fix `hu_eval_suite_load_json` to actually parse tasks array (currently only parses name)
2. Implement `hu_eval_run_suite(alloc, suite, provider, model, run_out)` — iterates tasks, sends prompt to provider, collects response, checks against expected
3. Add timeout handling per task (`timeout_ms` field)
4. Wire `category` and `difficulty` fields into filtering
5. Implement `hu_eval_result_free` and `hu_eval_run_free` (currently no-ops)
6. Add CLI command: `human eval run <suite.json> [--provider X] [--model Y]`
7. Add CLI command: `human eval compare <baseline.json> <current.json>`

**Tests:**

- `eval_runner_loads_suite_from_json` — parse fixture with 5 tasks
- `eval_runner_executes_tasks_sequentially` — mock provider, verify results
- `eval_runner_respects_timeout` — task exceeding timeout marked failed
- `eval_runner_filters_by_category` — only run "reasoning" tasks
- `eval_runner_filters_by_difficulty` — only run difficulty >= 3
- `eval_runner_produces_json_report` — verify report structure
- `eval_runner_compare_detects_regression` — pass_rate drop flagged

**Definition of Done:**

- [x] `hu_eval_suite_load_json` parses all fields including tasks array
- [x] Runner executes tasks against mock provider and produces correct pass/fail
- [x] Timeout enforcement works (task killed after timeout_ms)
- [x] JSON report includes per-task results with elapsed_ms and tokens_used
- [x] Compare function detects regressions (>5% pass_rate drop)
- [x] CLI commands functional: `human eval run`, `human eval compare`
- [x] All tests pass, 0 ASan errors

**Quality Gate:**

- Unit tests cover happy path, timeout, empty suite, malformed JSON
- Report JSON parseable by external tools
- Round-trip: load → run → report → compare works end-to-end

**SOTA Proof Point:**

- Can execute a 50-task eval suite in <30 seconds
- Report format compatible with standard eval dashboards

---

## AGI-E2: LLM-as-Judge

**Description:** Implement the `HU_EVAL_LLM_JUDGE` match mode so evaluation can use an LLM to assess open-ended responses against rubrics.

**Files:**

- Modify: `src/eval.c` — implement LLM judge path in `hu_eval_check`
- Create: `src/eval_judge.c` — judge prompt construction and response parsing
- Create: `include/human/eval_judge.h` — judge interface
- Create: `tests/test_eval_judge.c` — judge tests

**Steps:**

1. Define judge prompt template: system prompt with rubric, user prompt with (question, expected, actual)
2. Implement `hu_eval_judge_check(alloc, provider, actual, expected, rubric, score_out, reasoning_out)`
3. Parse judge response for score (1-5) and reasoning
4. Map score to pass/fail (configurable threshold, default >= 3)
5. Add rubric field to `hu_eval_task_t`
6. Cache judge responses to avoid redundant API calls
7. Support custom rubrics per task and default rubric per suite

**Tests:**

- `eval_judge_scores_correct_answer_high` — exact match → 5/5
- `eval_judge_scores_wrong_answer_low` — totally wrong → 1/5
- `eval_judge_scores_partial_answer` — partially correct → 3/5
- `eval_judge_parses_score_from_response` — various LLM output formats
- `eval_judge_uses_custom_rubric` — rubric affects scoring
- `eval_judge_caches_results` — same input returns cached score

**Definition of Done:**

- [x] LLM judge produces scores 1-5 with reasoning text
- [x] Custom rubrics supported per-task and per-suite
- [x] Judge prompt follows best practices (clear rubric, structured output)
- [x] Cache prevents duplicate judge calls
- [x] Mock path works under `HU_IS_TEST`
- [x] All tests pass, 0 ASan errors

**Quality Gate:**

- Judge prompt reviewed against `docs/standards/ai/evaluation.md`
- Score distribution is reasonable (not all 5s or all 1s on diverse inputs)
- Reasoning text is coherent and references the rubric

**SOTA Proof Point:**

- Judge correlation with human ratings > 0.8 (measured on a held-out set)
- Supports both absolute scoring and pairwise comparison

---

## AGI-E3: Benchmark Harnesses (GAIA, SWE-bench, WebArena)

**Description:** Create harness adapters that can load industry-standard benchmark datasets and run them through our eval framework.

**Files:**

- Create: `src/eval_benchmarks.c` — benchmark loader adapters

- Create: `tests/test_eval_benchmarks.c` — benchmark tests
- Modify: `src/cli_commands.c` — add `human eval benchmark <name>` command

**Steps:**

1. Define GAIA adapter: load GAIA JSON format → `hu_eval_suite_t`
2. Define SWE-bench adapter: load SWE-bench instances, evaluate patch correctness
3. Define tool-use benchmark: multi-step tool invocation with verification
4. Create sample eval suites (10 tasks each) for development/CI
5. Add `--benchmark gaia|swebench|tooluse` CLI flag
6. Implement result normalization across benchmark formats
7. Add regression tracking: store results in SQLite, compare across runs

**Tests:**

- `benchmark_gaia_loads_format` — GAIA JSON parsed correctly
- `benchmark_swebench_loads_format` — SWE-bench format parsed
- `benchmark_tooluse_loads_format` — tool-use format parsed
- `benchmark_regression_detects_drop` — historical comparison works
- `benchmark_results_stored_in_db` — SQLite persistence verified

**Definition of Done:**

- [x] Three benchmark adapters load their respective formats
- [x] Sample suites included for CI testing
- [x] Results stored in SQLite with run metadata (date, provider, model, commit)
- [x] CLI command `human eval benchmark gaia` works end-to-end
- [x] Regression tracking flags >5% drops
- [x] All tests pass, 0 ASan errors

**Quality Gate:**

- Benchmark results reproducible (same suite + same mock = same score)
- SQLite schema includes indexes for efficient historical queries
- Sample suites cover all difficulty levels

**SOTA Proof Point:**

- Framework can ingest real GAIA dataset and produce scores
- Regression tracking catches intentional degradations in CI

---

## AGI-E4: Eval Dashboard & CI Integration

**Description:** Wire eval into CI pipeline and provide a CLI-based dashboard for tracking progress across benchmarks over time.

**Files:**

- Modify: `src/cli_commands.c` — add `human eval dashboard` command
- Create: `src/eval_dashboard.c` — dashboard renderer (terminal)
- Create: `.github/workflows/eval.yml` — CI eval workflow
- Modify: `src/eval.c` — add SQLite-backed historical storage

**Steps:**

1. Implement terminal-based dashboard: table of benchmarks × last 5 runs × pass_rate
2. Add trend indicators (↑↓→) for each benchmark
3. Create CI workflow that runs sample suites on every PR
4. Fail CI if any benchmark regresses >5% from baseline
5. Store eval results as CI artifacts
6. Add `human eval history [--benchmark X] [--last N]` command

**Tests:**

- `dashboard_renders_benchmark_table` — output contains headers and data
- `dashboard_shows_trend_indicators` — ↑ for improvement, ↓ for regression
- `history_returns_last_n_runs` — pagination works

**Definition of Done:**

- [x] `human eval dashboard` shows all benchmarks with trend data
- [x] CI workflow runs eval on every PR
- [x] CI fails on regression >5%
- [x] Historical data persisted across runs
- [x] All tests pass, 0 ASan errors

**Phase 1 Audit Notes (2026-03-15):** Task loader parses tasks array; runner + benchmark adapters + dashboard exist. LLM-as-judge (`eval_judge.c`) not implemented — uses EXACT/CONTAINS only. Regression: `hu_eval_compare` produces delta; `eval_check_regression.py` runs on golden-set (schedule), not on PR. No SQLite historical storage in eval.c. 5522 tests pass, 0 ASan errors.

**Phase 1 Exit Quality Rating Target: B** — **Actual: C** (LLM judge, historical storage missing)

---

# Phase 2: World Model & Strategic Reasoning

> _"An agent that cannot simulate consequences before acting is flying blind."_

**Goal:** Upgrade the world model from keyword-based lookups to a graph-based causal reasoning engine with simulation, counterfactual analysis, and planning with lookahead. Upgrade ToT to recursive multi-level with beam search.

**Timeline:** 3 weeks
**Risk:** Medium (modifies intelligence subsystem, but isolated from main agent loop until wired in)
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (need eval to measure reasoning quality)

---

## AGI-W1: Causal Graph Engine

**Description:** Replace keyword-based world model with a proper causal graph that stores entities, actions, outcomes, and causal edges with confidence and temporal metadata.

**Files:**

- Rewrite: `src/intelligence/world_model.c` — graph-based engine
- Modify: `include/human/intelligence/world_model.h` — new graph API
- Create: `tests/test_world_model_graph.c` — graph tests

**Steps:**

1. Design causal graph schema: `causal_nodes` (id, type, label, properties), `causal_edges` (source, target, type, confidence, evidence_count, last_observed)
2. Implement `hu_world_add_node`, `hu_world_add_edge`, `hu_world_get_neighbors`
3. Edge types: CAUSES, PREVENTS, ENABLES, CORRELATES, TEMPORAL_FOLLOWS
4. Implement `hu_world_trace_causal_chain(start_node, max_depth)` — BFS/DFS through causal edges
5. Implement `hu_world_find_paths(from, to, max_depth)` — all causal paths between two nodes
6. Replace `extract_keyword` hack with proper entity extraction
7. Migrate `causal_observations` data to graph on init (backward compat)
8. Use `simulation_cache` table (currently unused) for caching predictions

**Tests:**

- `world_graph_edge_confidence_updates` — repeated observation increases confidence
- `world_graph_temporal_ordering` — edges respect time
- `world_graph_migration_preserves_data` — old observations become graph nodes

**Definition of Done:**

- [x] Graph schema with nodes, edges, types, confidence, timestamps
- [x] BFS causal chain traversal to configurable depth
- [x] Path finding between arbitrary nodes
- [x] Confidence updates on repeated observations
- [x] Backward-compatible migration from flat table
- [x] Simulation cache populated and used
- [x] All tests pass, 0 ASan errors

**Quality Gate:**

- Graph operations O(V+E) not O(V²)
- SQLite indexes on edge source/target columns
- No memory leaks in graph traversal (ASan clean)

**SOTA Proof Point:**

- Causal chain queries return in <10ms for graphs with 1000+ nodes
- Multi-hop causal reasoning (depth 5+) produces coherent explanations
- Architecture aligns with MAGMA multi-graph pattern

---

## AGI-W2: Simulative Reasoning Engine

**Files:**

- Modify: `src/intelligence/world_model.c` — add simulation engine
- Modify: `include/human/intelligence/world_model.h` — simulation API
- Create: `tests/test_world_simulation.c` — simulation tests

**Steps:**

1. Implement `hu_world_simulate_action(action, context, prediction_out)` — hybrid: graph traversal + LLM synthesis
2. Graph path: find relevant causal chains for the action entity, collect outcome distributions
3. LLM path: construct prompt with causal context + action + history, ask for predicted outcomes
4. Implement `hu_world_compare_actions(actions[], n, rankings_out)` — rank by predicted utility
5. Implement `hu_world_what_if(action, constraints, scenarios_out)` — generate alternative scenarios
6. Cache simulation results with TTL (avoid redundant LLM calls)
7. Track simulation accuracy: log predicted vs actual outcomes for calibration

**Tests:**

- `simulation_predicts_known_outcome` — action with clear causal chain → correct prediction
- `simulation_handles_novel_action` — no graph data → LLM-only prediction
- `simulation_ranks_actions_by_utility` — best action ranked first
- `simulation_what_if_generates_scenarios` — 3 distinct scenarios
- `simulation_cache_hit_avoids_llm` — cached prediction returned

**Definition of Done:**

- [x] Hybrid graph+LLM simulation produces predictions with confidence scores
- [x] Action ranking returns ordered list with reasoning
- [x] What-if analysis generates distinct plausible scenarios
- [x] Simulation cache reduces LLM calls by 50%+ on repeated queries
- [x] Accuracy tracking stores calibration data
- [x] All tests pass, 0 ASan errors

**Quality Gate:**

- Predictions include confidence intervals, not point estimates
- Simulation prompt follows `docs/standards/ai/prompt-engineering.md`
- Cache TTL configurable (default 1 hour)

**SOTA Proof Point:**

- Simulative reasoning improves task success rate by >10% on eval benchmark (measured in Phase 1 harness)
- Architecture aligns with SIMURA pattern (LLM as world model substrate)

---

## AGI-W3: Recursive Tree-of-Thought with Beam Search

**Description:** Upgrade ToT from single-level branching to recursive multi-level exploration with beam search, scoring, and pruning.

**Files:**

- Rewrite: `src/agent/tree_of_thought.c` — recursive ToT with beam search
- Modify: `include/human/agent.h` — updated ToT config
- Create: `tests/test_tot_recursive.c` — recursive ToT tests

**Steps:**

1. Implement recursive `explore_level(thoughts, depth, config)` — expand each thought into children
2. At each level: generate N children, score all candidates, keep top K (beam width)
3. Implement configurable strategies: BFS, DFS, best-first, beam search
4. Add `max_total_nodes` limit to prevent runaway exploration
5. Implement thought aggregation: combine best leaf thoughts into coherent plan
6. Fix `parse_thoughts` fragility — use structured JSON output instead of text parsing
7. Add metrics: nodes explored, nodes pruned, max depth reached, total LLM calls

**Tests:**

- `tot_recursive_depth_3` — explores 3 levels deep
- `tot_beam_search_prunes_correctly` — only top-K survive each level
- `tot_best_first_explores_promising` — highest-score branch explored first
- `tot_max_nodes_respected` — stops at limit
- `tot_aggregation_produces_plan` — leaf thoughts combined
- `tot_json_output_parsed` — structured output more robust than text

**Definition of Done:**

- [x] Recursive exploration to configurable depth (default 3, max 5)
- [x] Beam search keeps top-K at each level (default K=3)
- [x] Best-first strategy available as alternative
- [x] Max total nodes enforced (default 50)
- [x] Aggregation produces coherent combined plan
- [x] Structured JSON output replaces fragile text parsing
- [x] Metrics tracked (nodes, depth, LLM calls)
- [x] All tests pass, 0 ASan errors

**Quality Gate:**

- Beam search reduces LLM calls by >40% vs exhaustive BFS
- Recursive depth improves reasoning quality on eval benchmark
- No exponential blowup (bounded by max_total_nodes)

**SOTA Proof Point:**

- Recursive ToT + beam search matches or exceeds single-level ToT on reasoning benchmarks
- Planning quality measurably improves on multi-step tasks (measured via Phase 1 eval)

---

## AGI-W4: Planning with Lookahead (MCTS-Inspired)

**Description:** Implement Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired planning that combines ToT exploration with world model simulation to evaluate action sequences before execution.

**Files:**

- Create: `src/agent/mcts_planner.c` — MCTS-style planning
- Create: `include/human/agent/mcts_planner.h` — planner interface
- Modify: `src/agent/planner.c` — integrate MCTS as planning strategy
- Create: `tests/test_mcts_planner.c` — planner tests

**Steps:**

1. Implement selection: choose most promising unexplored action path (UCB1 scoring)
2. Implement expansion: generate possible next actions from current state
3. Implement simulation: use world model to predict outcome of action sequence
4. Implement backpropagation: update path scores based on simulated outcomes
5. Implement budget: max iterations, max time, or max LLM calls
6. Wire into existing planner as `planning_strategy: "mcts"` config option
7. Add progressive deepening: start shallow, go deeper if budget allows

**Tests:**

- `mcts_selects_best_path` — highest-value path selected
- `mcts_expands_unexplored` — new actions generated
- `mcts_simulates_outcomes` — world model called for prediction
- `mcts_backpropagates_scores` — path scores updated
- `mcts_respects_budget` — stops at iteration limit
- `mcts_progressive_deepening` — depth increases with budget

**Definition of Done:**

- [x] UCB1 selection balances exploration/exploitation
- [x] World model integration for outcome simulation
- [x] Budget enforcement (iterations, time, LLM calls)
- [x] Progressive deepening works
- [x] Integrates with existing planner via config flag
- [x] All tests pass, 0 ASan errors

**Quality Gate:**

- MCTS planner outperforms greedy planner on multi-step eval tasks
- Budget controls prevent runaway LLM costs
- Planning time <5 seconds for typical tasks

**SOTA Proof Point:**

- Planning with lookahead reduces multi-step task failure rate by >15%
- Architecture aligns with SIMURA simulative reasoning pattern

---

## AGI-W5: Context-Aware Simulation

**Description:** Make the world model context-aware — currently `context` parameter is ignored in `hu_world_simulate` and `hu_world_counterfactual`.

**Files:**

- Modify: `src/intelligence/world_model.c` — use context in all queries
- Modify: `include/human/intelligence/world_model.h` — context types
- Create: `tests/test_world_context.c` — context-aware tests

**Steps:**

1. Define `hu_world_context_t` struct: entities, temporal_window, user_state, environmental_factors
2. Use context to filter relevant causal graph subgraph
3. Use context in LLM simulation prompts
4. Context-dependent confidence adjustment (recent context → higher confidence)
5. Implement `hu_world_context_from_conversation(history, context_out)` — extract context from chat

**Tests:**

- `context_filters_relevant_nodes` — only context-relevant graph nodes used
- `context_affects_prediction` — same action, different context → different prediction
- `context_from_conversation_extracts_entities` — entities extracted from chat
- `context_recency_boosts_confidence` — recent observations weighted higher

**Definition of Done:**

- [x] Context struct defined with entities, temporal, user state, environment
- [x] Simulation uses context to filter graph and adjust predictions
- [x] Conversation context extraction works
- [x] All tests pass, 0 ASan errors

**Quality Gate:**

- Context-aware predictions measurably more accurate than context-free on eval suite

**SOTA Proof Point:**

- Aligns with CDWM's environment/intervention pathway decomposition

- Create: `tests/test_research_executor.c` — executor tests

**Steps:**

1. Add priority ordering to `hu_findings_get_pending` (sort by priority × relevance)
2. Add deduplication: hash on (source, finding) to prevent duplicates
3. Implement `hu_research_execute_finding(finding, result_out)` — execute suggested action
4. Safety gates: actions must be classified as safe (no security changes, no data deletion)
5. Implement action types: prompt_update, skill_creation, knowledge_addition, config_suggestion
6. Wire research executor into cron schedule (daily after research scan)
7. Require human approval for high-risk actions (via CLI confirmation)

**Tests:**

2. Graph types: SEMANTIC (embedding similarity), TEMPORAL (co-occurrence in time window), ENTITY (shared entities), CAUSAL (cause-effect from world model)
3. Implement policy-guided traversal: given query, select which graphs to traverse based on query type
4. Implement multi-graph fusion: combine results from multiple graph traversals with RRF
5. Implement bridge discovery: find missing logical paths between disconnected facts (AriadneMem pattern)
6. Wire into existing hybrid retrieval as additional signal

- `multimodal_audio_transcribed_and_sent` — audio transcribed + content part
- `multimodal_video_keyframes_extracted` — video processed to keyframes

## AGI-M2: Cross-Modal Memory & Retrieval

**Description:** Enable memory to store and retrieve across modalities — image memories retrievable by text query, audio memories searchable by content.

**Files:**

- Create: `src/memory/multimodal_index.c` — cross-modal memory indexing
- Create: `include/human/memory/multimodal_index.h` — index interface
- Modify: `src/memory/retrieval/hybrid.c` — multimodal retrieval
- Create: `tests/test_multimodal_memory.c` — memory tests

**Steps:**

1. Implement multimodal embedding: unified embedding space for text, image descriptions, audio transcripts
2. Store modality metadata with memory entries (type, format, description, raw_ref)
3. Cross-modal retrieval: text query → find relevant images/audio/video
4. Implement modality-aware RAG: include image thumbnails or audio summaries in context
5. Wire into memory graph: multimodal content creates entity and semantic edges

**Tests:**

- `multimodal_memory_stores_image_with_text` — image + description stored
- `multimodal_memory_text_query_finds_image` — text search returns image memory
- `multimodal_memory_cross_modal_edges` — image and text about same topic linked

**Definition of Done:**

- [x] Multimodal content stored with type metadata
- [x] Cross-modal retrieval works (text → image, text → audio)
- [x] Integrated with memory graph
- [x] All tests pass, 0 ASan errors

**Quality Gate:**

## AGI-M3: Full-Duplex Voice Architecture

**Description:** Upgrade voice from API wrapper to full-duplex architecture with interrupt handling and low-latency processing.

**Files:**

- Create: `include/human/voice/duplex.h` — duplex interface
- Modify: `src/channels/voice_channel.c` — duplex integration
- Create: `tests/test_voice_duplex.c` — duplex tests

**Steps:**

1. Implement dual-stream architecture: input stream (user audio) and output stream (agent audio) run simultaneously
2. Implement interrupt detection: user speaking while agent is speaking → cancel agent output
3. Implement voice activity detection (VAD): detect speech start/end for turn management
4. Implement streaming output: start generating audio before full response is ready
5. Implement pre-fetch: predict likely follow-up topics and pre-generate partial responses
6. Target: <200ms first-byte latency for response
7. Implement graceful degradation: fall back to turn-based if duplex not supported

**Tests:**

- `duplex_simultaneous_streams` — input and output active simultaneously
- `duplex_interrupt_cancels_output` — user interruption stops agent speech
- `duplex_vad_detects_speech` — speech start/end detected
- `duplex_streaming_starts_early` — audio begins before full response
- `duplex_fallback_to_turn_based` — graceful degradation works

**Definition of Done:**

2. Implement goal management: long-term goals decomposed into daily/weekly objectives
3. Implement intrinsic motivation: agent generates own goals from patterns, curiosity, and user needs
4. Implement sleep-like consolidation: periodic memory compaction, experience distillation, skill refinement
5. Implement narrative identity: maintain coherent self-model across sessions
6. Implement proactive scheduling: agent decides when to work on goals without being asked
7. Wire into daemon: autonomy engine runs alongside reactive message handling

**Tests:**

- `autonomy_externalizes_state` — state saved to files, context bounded
- `autonomy_maintains_goals_across_sessions` — goals persist
