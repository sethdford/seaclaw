# iMessage Capability Matrix

## Overview

Canonical reference for every iMessage platform capability, our implementation status, user behavior data, technical feasibility, and priority. Cross-references existing investigation docs and third-party tools.

## Platform Capabilities

| Feature | User Behavior | Feasibility | Our Status | Priority | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Send text** | Core (100%) | Public API (imsg CLI or AppleScript) | Implemented | — | `imessage_send()` via `imsg send` (preferred) or osascript fallback; `use_imsg_cli` config key |
| **Receive/poll text** | Core (100%) | chat.db SQLite + imsg watch | Implemented | — | `hu_imessage_poll()` via chat.db; event-driven `imsg watch` subprocess when `use_imsg_cli` enabled |
| **Send attachment** | High (~40% of convos) | imsg CLI or AppleScript | Implemented | — | `imsg send --file` (preferred) with per-attachment AppleScript fallback |
| **Receive attachment path** | High | chat.db + attachment table | Implemented | — | `hu_imessage_get_attachment_path()` |
| **Classic tapback (send)** | Very high (70%+ of users) | JXA + AX automation | Implemented (fragile) | High | Requires AX permission, varies by macOS version. `HU_IMESSAGE_TAPBACK_ENABLED` opt-in. |
| **Classic tapback (read)** | Very high | chat.db types 2000-2005 | Implemented | — | `hu_imessage_build_tapback_context()` |
| **Custom emoji reaction (read)** | Growing (iOS 17+) | chat.db type 2006 | **Implemented** (this overhaul) | — | Added in this overhaul, aggregated in tapback context |
| **Custom emoji reaction (send)** | Growing | imsg CLI or private API | **Blocked** | Medium | imsg CLI accepts emoji directly as `--reaction` value (e.g., `-r 🎉`); requires vtable extension to carry emoji string through `react()` |
| **Proactive image generation** | High | DALL-E 3 + iMessage attachment | **Implemented** | — | 2% trigger, LLM prompt → DALL-E → download → send as attachment |
| **Read receipts (read)** | ~77% of users enable | chat.db date_read column | Implemented | — | `hu_imessage_build_read_receipt_context()` |
| **Read receipts (send)** | — | No public API | Not possible | — | Apple controls this per-contact |
| **Typing indicator (send)** | High (humanizing) | System Events AX automation | **Implemented** (AX-based) | — | System Events AX automation: focus Messages.app input field + keystroke to trigger real '...' bubble. No private entitlements needed. Requires Accessibility permission. |
| **Typing indicator (read)** | — | No public API | Not possible | — | Ephemeral, not stored in chat.db |
| **Inline reply (read)** | Moderate | chat.db thread_originator_guid | Implemented | — | `hu_imessage_lookup_message_by_guid()` |
| **Inline reply (send)** | Moderate | No public API | Not possible | — | Neither AppleScript nor imsg support this |
| **Edit message (send)** | 1 in 50 messages | Not feasible (see investigation) | Not implemented | — | See `imessage-edit-feasibility.md`. IMCore private API only. |
| **Unsend message** | 1 in 50 messages | Partially feasible (AX automation) | Not implemented | Low | See `imessage-unsend-feasibility.md`. 2-minute window, fragile. |
| **Abandoned typing** | Humanizing pattern | Not feasible (see investigation) | Not implemented | — | See `imessage-abandoned-typing-feasibility.md` |
| **Music preview send (30s)** | Common | iTunes/Spotify API + AppleScript attachment | **Implemented** | — | iTunes .m4a preview + optional album art + Spotify/Apple Music rich link (auto-detected from user preference). Taste learning tracks reactions with persistent storage (~/.human/music_taste.json). Spotify token cached with expiry. See `src/music.c`. |
| **GIF send** | Common | Tenor API + AppleScript attachment | Implemented | — | `hu_imessage_fetch_gif()` + send as attachment |
| **GIF tapback tracking** | — | chat.db | Implemented | — | `hu_imessage_count_recent_gif_tapbacks()` (now includes type 2006) |
| **Message effects (read)** | Common | chat.db expressive_send_style_id | **Implemented** (this overhaul) | — | Detects all 13 bubble/screen effects (Slam, Loud, Gentle, Invisible Ink, Confetti, Echo, Fireworks, Happy Birthday, Heart, Lasers, Shooting Star, Sparkles, Spotlight) and shows `[Sent with <effect>]` prefix in content. |
| **Message effects (send)** | Common | No public API | Not possible | — | Neither AppleScript nor imsg CLI supports sending effects. imessage-rs and Advanced iMessage Kit do via private API (requires SIP disabled). |
| **Sticker/Memoji (read)** | 1B+ Memoji weekly, 40% created | chat.db balloon_bundle_id | **Implemented** (this overhaul) | — | Detects stickers, Memoji, and iMessage apps via `balloon_bundle_id` in poll output. Shows [Sticker], [Memoji], or [iMessage App] in content. |
| **Sticker/Memoji (send)** | — | No public API | Not possible | — | No AppleScript/CLI path |
| **Group chat (send)** | High | AppleScript (via chat name) | Implemented | — | Works with group chat identifiers |
| **Group chat (poll)** | High | chat.db | Implemented | — | Polls from all chats |
| **Contact allow-list** | — | Internal | Implemented | — | `allow_from` filter in create() |
| **Health check** | — | chat.db accessibility | Implemented | — | Checks if chat.db is readable |
| **attributedBody parsing** | Required for macOS 15+ | Binary blob parsing | **Implemented** (this overhaul) | — | Now shared across channels, feeds, persona sampler |
| **User activity detection** | — | chat.db is_from_me | Implemented | — | `hu_imessage_user_responded_recently()` |
| **Unsent message detection** | — | chat.db | Implemented | — | `was_unsent` field in poll output |

## Existing Investigation Cross-References

| Investigation | File | Conclusion | Changed Since? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Edit messages | `imessage-edit-feasibility.md` (2026-03-08) | Not feasible via public APIs | No — imsg still has no edit |
| Unsend messages | `imessage-unsend-feasibility.md` (2026-03-08) | Partially feasible (AX automation) | No — imsg has no unsend |
| Abandoned typing | `imessage-abandoned-typing-feasibility.md` (2026-03-10) | Not feasible | Minor — imsg v0.5.0 had typing but broken on macOS 26 |
| Typing indicators (AX) | `imessage-abandoned-typing-feasibility.md` (updated 2026-04) | AX workaround now implemented | Yes — AX typing works; abandoned typing still not feasible |

## Decision Log

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use AppleScript for send | Public API, no private deps, works across macOS versions | Original |
| JXA+AX for tapback send | Only viable public path for reactions | Original |
| Opt-in tapback via CMake flag | Fragile, requires AX permission | Original |
| Add custom emoji reaction read (type 2006) | iOS 17+ feature, read-only via chat.db, zero risk | 2026-04 |
| Extract attributedBody parser to shared | Needed by feeds + persona sampler, pure byte parsing | 2026-04 |
| Evaluate imsg CLI for tapback | Potentially more reliable than JXA, active maintenance | 2026-04 (pending) |
| Do not implement edit/unsend | Private API only, high maintenance risk | 2026-03 |
| Implement AX-based typing indicators | System Events focus + keystroke triggers real "..." bubble; no private entitlements; same AX permission as tapback | 2026-04 |
| Add sticker/Memoji read-side detection | balloon_bundle_id check in poll; zero risk read-only | 2026-04 |
| Add message effects read-side detection | expressive_send_style_id check in poll; zero risk read-only | 2026-04 |
| imsg CLI as unified runtime control | `use_imsg_cli` config key is single control; removed `HU_IMESSAGE_SEND_IMSG` CMake flag | 2026-04 |
| imsg CLI tapback even without JXA enabled | Auto-detect imsg on $PATH; try before returning NOT_SUPPORTED | 2026-04 |
| imsg send --file for attachments | Per-attachment imsg CLI with AppleScript fallback; faster and better errors | 2026-04 |
| imsg watch for event-driven polling | Spawns `imsg watch --json --since-rowid` subprocess; pipe-based notification; SQL skipped when no data | 2026-04 |
| imsg chats for target validation | One-time startup check: `imsg chats --json`; warns if default_target not in active chats | 2026-04 |
| Poll interval auto-reduction | Bootstrap sets 1s when `use_imsg_cli` enabled (vs 3s default); watch skips SQL when idle | 2026-04 |
| Implement 30s music preview attachments | iTunes + Spotify dual-service: .m4a preview, album art, auto-detect Spotify/Apple preference from history, taste learning via tapback reactions. | 2026-04 |

## Architecture

- **Outbound text**: `imessage_send()` → `imsg send --to --text` (preferred, <1s) → AppleScript fallback (2-5s)
- **Outbound attachments**: `imsg send --to --file` (preferred, per-attachment) → AppleScript `POSIX file` fallback
- **Inbound (event-driven)**: `imsg watch --json --since-rowid` subprocess → pipe notification → `hu_imessage_poll()` → chat.db SQLite (only when data available)
- **Inbound (fallback)**: timer-based `hu_imessage_poll()` → chat.db SQLite → parse text + attributedBody + attachments + reactions
- **Outbound typing**: `imessage_start_typing()` → osascript System Events → focus Messages.app input field + keystroke (triggers real "..." typing bubble)
- **Sticker/effects detection**: `hu_imessage_poll()` reads `balloon_bundle_id` and `expressive_send_style_id` from chat.db
- **Tapback send**: `imessage_react()` → `imsg react --chat-id --reaction` (preferred) → JXA + System Events AX fallback (opt-in)
- **Target validation**: `imsg chats --json` at channel start → warn if `default_target` not found
- **Feed/persona**: `feeds/imessage.c` and `persona/sampler.c` → chat.db with attributedBody support
- **Music preview**: taste prompt → LLM picks song → detect user preference (Spotify/Apple Music) → iTunes search (for .m4a) + optional Spotify search (for share link) → download preview + album art → send text + audio + artwork attachments → record for taste learning
- **GIF**: Tenor API → download to temp file → send as attachment
