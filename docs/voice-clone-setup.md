# Voice Cloning Setup

Clone your voice for use with Cartesia TTS. Once cloned, Human uses your voice for all text-to-speech output — including voice messages sent via iMessage, Telegram, Discord, and other channels.

## Prerequisites

- **Cartesia API key**: Set `CARTESIA_API_KEY` environment variable, or add it to `~/.human/config.json` under `providers.cartesia.api_key`.
- **Build with Cartesia**: `cmake --preset dev -DHU_ENABLE_CARTESIA=ON` (or any preset with Cartesia enabled).
- **Audio sample**: 5–10 seconds of clear speech in a quiet environment. Supported formats: WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF, OGG.

## Quick Start (CLI)

```bash
# Record a 10-second sample (use any recording tool)
# Then clone it and assign to your persona:
human voice clone --file ~/my-voice-sample.wav --name "My Voice" --persona seth

# Verify the persona was updated:
human persona show seth | grep voice_id
```

## CLI Reference

```
human voice clone --file <path> [--name <name>] [--lang <code>] [--persona <name>]
```

| Flag | Description | Default |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `--file` | Path to audio file (required) | — |
| `--name` | Name for the cloned voice | "My Voice" |
| `--lang` | ISO 639-1 language code | "en" |
| `--persona` | Auto-update this persona's voice config | (none) |

## Gateway API

The `voice.clone` JSON-RPC method accepts base64-encoded audio:

```json
{
  "method": "voice.clone",
  "params": {
    "audio": "<base64-encoded-audio>",
    "mimeType": "audio/wav",
    "name": "My Voice",
    "language": "en",
    "persona": "seth"
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "voice_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "name": "My Voice",
  "language": "en"
}
```

## Web Dashboard

1. Navigate to the **Voice** view.
2. Click **Clone Voice** in the status bar.
3. Enter a voice name and optionally a persona name.
4. Click **Start Recording** and speak for 5–10 seconds.
5. Click **Stop & Clone** to upload and create the voice.

## Agent Tool

The agent has access to a `voice_clone` tool. It can be invoked by the LLM:

```json
{
  "tool": "voice_clone",
  "args": {
    "file_path": "/path/to/audio.wav",
    "name": "User Voice",
    "language": "en",
    "persona": "seth"
  }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Upload**: Audio is sent to Cartesia's `POST /voices/clone` endpoint.
2. **Clone**: Cartesia processes the audio and returns a voice UUID.
3. **Persona Update**: If a persona name is provided, the voice UUID is written into `~/.human/personas/<name>.json` under `voice.voice_id` with `voice.provider = "cartesia"`.
4. **TTS Usage**: All subsequent TTS synthesis uses the cloned voice ID. The daemon's outbound voice pipeline reads `voice_id` from the active persona and passes it to `hu_cartesia_tts_synthesize()`.

## Persona JSON Structure

After cloning, the persona file includes:

```json
{
  "identity": { ... },
  "voice": {
    "voice_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
    "provider": "cartesia"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- **"voice cloning not available in this build"**: Rebuild with `-DHU_ENABLE_CARTESIA=ON -DHU_ENABLE_CURL=ON`.
- **"CARTESIA_API_KEY environment variable not set"**: Export the key or add it to config.
- **Clone fails with error**: Ensure the audio is 5–10 seconds of clear speech. Very short clips (<3s) or noisy recordings may fail.
- **Voice sounds wrong**: Re-record in a quiet environment. Speak naturally at your normal pace and volume.

## Architecture

```
CLI (human voice clone)
        │
        ▼
hu_voice_clone_from_file()  ─── src/tts/voice_clone.c
        │
        ├─ curl POST /voices/clone (Cartesia API)
        │
        ▼
hu_persona_set_voice_id()   ─── src/tts/voice_clone.c
        │
        ▼
~/.human/personas/<name>.json updated

Gateway (voice.clone RPC)
        │
        ▼
cp_voice_clone()            ─── src/gateway/cp_voice_clone.c
        │
        ├─ base64 decode → hu_voice_clone_from_bytes()
        │
        ▼
Same flow as CLI

Agent Tool (voice_clone)
        │
        ▼
src/tools/voice_clone.c     ─── delegates to hu_voice_clone_from_file()
