# Human Competitive Benchmarks

This is a living document updated quarterly. It combines automated PageSpeed data with manual quality audits to benchmark Human against industry leaders across performance, visual craft, motion, accessibility, and innovation.

**Methodology**: Automated metrics (Lighthouse, CWV) are collected via CI; quality scores are assigned by human auditors using the rubric below. Each dimension is scored 1–10; totals are out of 70.

## Category-Defining Targets

Human's targets vs industry best:

| Metric                 | Industry Best      | Human Target |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| Lighthouse Performance | 95–97 (Vercel)     | 99+          |
| LCP                    | 0.8s (Linear)      | < 0.5s       |
| CLS                    | ~0.02 (Stripe)     | 0.00         |
| INP                    | ~80ms (Superhuman) | < 50ms       |
| Accessibility          | 98 (Vercel)        | 100          |

Human's lightweight C runtime and minimal UI stack (Lit, design tokens) position it to exceed these targets. The dashboard and marketing site are optimized for sub-500ms LCP and zero layout shift.

## Update History

- **2026-03-13**: Award-winning UI sprint — spring-first motion, scroll-driven animations, glass expansion, brand consistency, LCP optimizations, quality infrastructure
- **2026-03-10**: First automated + manual audit completed (Q1 2026)
- **2026-03-09**: Initial benchmark registry created

## Cadence

- **Automated metrics**: Run quarterly via CI; results populate the Automated Metrics table.
- **Quality scores**: Manual audit once per quarter; assign scores using the rubric and document findings in the Quality Scorecard.

## Audit Checklist (Quality Scores)

When assigning manual quality scores, verify:

1. **Visual Craft**: Typography scale, spacing rhythm, color contrast, dark/light parity.
2. **Motion Quality**: Spring vs linear easing, choreography (stagger, follow-through), `prefers-reduced-motion` support.
3. **Information Density**: Data-ink ratio (Tufte), progressive disclosure, cognitive load per view.
4. **Brand Cohesion**: Token usage, cross-surface consistency (dashboard, website, native).
5. **Innovation**: Novel patterns, WebGL/3D usage, cutting-edge CSS (container queries, `:has`, etc.).

**Note**: For native-only brands (Raycast, Warp), web metrics apply to their marketing sites. Quality scores may include app impressions where applicable.

## Recent Changes (Q1 2026 Sprint)

Targeted improvements to close the gap with benchmark brands:

- **Lighthouse thresholds tightened**: Performance >= 97, Accessibility >= 99, CLS error at 0.01
- **Spring-first motion**: Modal, dialog, command palette, toast, tabs indicator, sidebar all upgraded to spring easing
- **Scroll-driven animations**: New `scroll-driven.css` utility file with `animation-timeline: scroll()` support
- **View Transitions expanded**: Named shared elements for page-hero and sidebar-indicator
- **Glass system**: Tooltip upgraded with `backdrop-filter` glass; all overlays now use glass
- **Brand consistency**: Website font tokens unified with dashboard, hardcoded motion values tokenized
- **LCP optimizations**: Font preload priority tuning, hero image `loading="eager"`, Astro inline stylesheets
- **Spring library expanded**: `springModalEnter`, `springModalExit`, `springStagger`, `springFocusRing`
- **Scroll entrance for all views**: Auto-applied via `GatewayAwareLitElement` base class
- **Quality infrastructure**: Component audit script, cross-surface token consistency checker, scorecard rubrics with concrete 9/10 criteria

## Sprint 2 Changes (Q1 2026)

- **CI quality enforcement**: `check:components` and `check-unused-tokens.sh` no longer `continue-on-error` — they block the build
- **Native app motion**: iOS spring animations standardized to `HUTokens.springExpressive` across all views
- **Native brand cohesion**: iOS TabView uses token-based accent tint, SettingsView uses Avenir fonts
- **Website build pipeline**: `prebuild` now runs `design-tokens` build to prevent token drift
- **Test coverage**: Added 90 tests for peripheral_ctrl, value_learning, and goal_engine — `check-untested.sh` passes clean
- **Reduced-motion compliance**: All 8 dashboard views now respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Scorecard re-audit**: Q1 2026 sprint scores confirmed and updated (Dashboard 56/70, Website 54/70, iOS 41/70)

## Sprint 3 Changes (Q1 2026)

- **Award-winning quality criteria**: New `docs/standards/quality/award-criteria.md` defines Awwwards, Apple Design Award, Google Play Best App submission checklists with measurable criteria
- **Lighthouse thresholds tightened**: Performance >= 98, Accessibility = 100, LCP error at 1500ms, CLS error at 0.005, TBT error at 50ms
- **Bundle size budget reduced**: 350KB → 300KB entry bundle
- **Component quality check fixed**: Bug where `--sc-*` was checked instead of `--hu-*` tokens — now correctly validates design token usage
- **Android Compose UI**: Full Compose app created — Overview, Chat, Settings screens with Material 3 + HUTokens theming, spring animations, Avenir typography
- **macOS design tokens**: SettingsView and HumanApp now use HUTokens (Avenir, accent colors, spring animations, tonal surfaces)
- **Website token compliance**: All hardcoded hex colors tokenized — terminal chrome uses `--hu-terminal-*` custom properties, transition durations use `--hu-duration-*` tokens
- **Automated quality scoring**: New `scripts/quality-score-report.sh` runs in CI, measuring component quality, token compliance, test coverage, cross-platform parity, accessibility, motion quality, reduced-motion support
- **CI quality gate**: New `quality-score` job in CI pipeline aggregates all quality signals

## Award Submission Readiness

| Program                  | Surface   | Status          | Blockers                                                            |
| ------------------------ | --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Awwwards**             | Website   | Not ready       | LCP too high (2.6s), missing WebGL hero, no scroll-driven narrative |
| **CSS Design Awards**    | Website   | Partially ready | Strong CSS innovation, needs production deployment                  |
| **Webby Awards**         | Dashboard | Partially ready | Strong UX, needs production deployment for judging                  |
| **Apple Design Awards**  | iOS       | Not ready       | Only 2 views, missing Dynamic Type, Live Activities, App Intents    |
| **Google Play Best App** | Android   | Not ready       | New Compose UI, needs polish, Accessibility Scanner, Widget         |

See `docs/standards/quality/award-criteria.md` for complete submission checklists.

## Next Steps

- Deploy h-uman.ai for production PageSpeed data and award submissions
- iOS feature parity: add Overview, Sessions views; Dynamic Type; App Intents for Siri
- Android polish: Accessibility Scanner audit, predictive back, widget
- Website WebGL hero element for Awwwards visual impact
- Website scroll-driven narrative sections with parallax
- Dashboard Lighthouse audit — target 99+ performance
- Flutter app: build Compose-equivalent screens or sunset decision
- Schedule Q2 2026 quarterly review with updated scores
